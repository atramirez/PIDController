# PID Controller

---

This is my version of a basic PID controller in C. There are many out there, but this is my flavor of how to input and reuse across my multiple projects.

I do plan on making this a CMake library to make this easier, so stay tuned if that interests you.

#### Helpful Resources

I used others code for inspiration and figuring out how I want mine to be laid out. Big shoutout to these projects, would recommend!
